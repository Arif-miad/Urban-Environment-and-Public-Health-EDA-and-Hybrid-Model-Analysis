# **Urban Environment and Public Health: EDA and Hybrid Model Analysis**

## **Overview**
This project explores the relationship between urban environmental factors and public health metrics, focusing on the Air Quality Index (AQI). By leveraging **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and a **Hybrid Machine Learning Model**, we aim to analyze and predict AQI based on features such as green coverage, population, vehicle count, and disease cases.

## **Dataset**
The dataset contains 2000 rows and 11 columns, including:
- **Population (%)**
- **AQI**
- **Green Coverage (%)**
- **Factories**
- **Vehicles Count**
- **Education Institutions Count**
- **Hospitals Count**
- **Waterborne Disease Cases**
- **Respiratory Disease Cases**
- **Year**

### **Data Source**
Provide the dataset source (e.g., a CSV file, Kaggle link, or other sources).

## **Project Goals**
1. Perform comprehensive **EDA** to uncover trends and insights.
2. Use a **hybrid machine learning model** combining Random Forest and Gradient Boosting to predict AQI.
3. Evaluate and visualize model performance using metrics and plots.
4. Highlight key urban factors influencing AQI and public health.
